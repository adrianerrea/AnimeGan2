Web application powered by Heroku. It enables you to upload a photo and the AnimeGanv2 algorithm will be applied to your original picture. Running locally allows you to download the new image created but running through voila in the web browser make it not work well.

Anyway, thanks to the original authors of the AnimeGanv2 to publish their hard work (https://github.com/TachibanaYoshino/AnimeGANv2). Specially, to the PyTorch implementation (https://github.com/bryandlee/animegan2-pytorch) since that is the code I used.

Enjoy!
